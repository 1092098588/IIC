# Invariant Information Clustering for Unsupervised Image Classification and Segmentation

This repository contains the code for the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.06653">IIC paper</a>.

IIC is an unsupervised clustering objective that trains neural networks into image classifiers and segmenters with state-of-the-art semantic accuracy.

Commands used to train the models in the paper are given <a href="https://github.com/xu-ji/IIC/blob/master/examples/commands/example_commands.txt">here</a>.

Information on how to setup the segmentation dataset sources is given <a href="https://github.com/xu-ji/IIC/blob/master/datasets/README.txt">here</a>.
