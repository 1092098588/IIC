# Invariant Information Clustering for Unsupervised Image Classification and Segmentation

This repository contains the code for the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.06653">IIC paper</a>.

IIC is an unsupervised clustering objective that trains neural networks into image classifiers and segmenters without labels, with state-of-the-art semantic accuracy.

We set 9 new state-of-the-art records on unsupervised STL10 (unsupervised variant of ImageNet), CIFAR10, CIFAR20, MNIST, COCO-Stuff-3, COCO-Stuff, Potsdam-3, Potsdam, and supervised/semisupervised STL.
